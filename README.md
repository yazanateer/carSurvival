# carSurvival

`carSurvival` is an Android game developed in Kotlin, where the player controls a car navigating through lanes while avoiding obstacles. The game features intuitive controls, increasing levels of difficulty, and immediate feedback on collisions through vibrations and toast messages.

## Features

- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Obstacles appear randomly across three lanes, challenging the player to dodge them by moving the car left or right.
- **Collision Detection**: Utilizes precise collision detection to determine impacts between the car and obstacles.
- **Vibration Feedback**: Provides haptic feedback through device vibration to indicate when the car collides with an obstacle.
- **Visual Feedback**: Utilizes toast messages to notify the player immediately upon collision.
- **Heart System**: A visual representation of the player's 'lives' through heart icons that disappear with each collision.
